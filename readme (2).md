# HOW TO OPEN A SPECIFIC TAB ON ANOTHER HTML PAGE

- cREATE an id/or class on the button that opens that particular tab e.g "defaultPaymentspage"

- and create a script that when the button on the other page is pressed, the script automatically clicks the button that opens the tab you and hooraa!

# CHANGES 26TH DEC 2023
The students dashboard, should not have much priviledges;

I think, the student dashboard is just an output display of what the teachers want the learners to see;

As a learner, my dashboard should enable me to:
1. View my personal information
I do not necessarily have the priviledge to change since, any changes should be reflected in the admin first - so it is the admin dashboard that should change this information

2. View assignments, notes. exams. past papers, etc

3. Upload assignments, chat with schoolmates and teachers, etc

## THESE 3 ARE THE MAIN FUNCTIONS OF A STUDENTS DASHBOARD

4. View, games, news, clubs, enroll, etc


## END OF VERSION XXXXX12262023-11:30PMXXXX



## START OF studentsdashone VERSION 12-26-2023
The changes in this version should ensure the fulfillment of at least the 3 main objectives;

Remove anything else that is unnecessary


1. Remove the edit functionality in personal info page

The personal info page's data is queried from the database and echoed onto the page using php;

--removed successfully

2. Make the notes, assign's, and exams sections as tabs
Tab 1 - Available notes, exams or assign's
Tab 2 - Upload functionality/ Aidditional function - where necessary

Tab 3 - Uploaded and complete assignments


# END ------- ASSIGNMENT TABS COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

# START EXAMS SECTION
Objective

TAB 1 - Show exam past papers, completed exams  coming exams, etc


Instead of having a tab for notes, exams and assignments, we could have them all under coursework - Under coursework, there will be a list of enrolled subjects; Each subject will have 4 tabs, notes, exams, assignments, discussion;

The reason for this change was because of uploading specific assignments for each subject or teacher; 

Changes to be reflected in the next version. - studentsdashtwo
